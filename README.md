Project Inventory Management System (Console-based) â€“ Python: This inventory management project is a command-line application designed to help wholesale businesses or small shops efficiently track and manage their stock, sales, and restocking processes. It stores all product information in a text file, ensuring that data is preserved between sessions.
 
Users can view a list of available products, sell items to customers (with automatic calculation and application of promotional offers such as "Buy 3 Get 1 Free"), and update inventory in real-time as transactions occur. The system also allows for restocking existing products or adding entirely new items, with each action generating detailed invoices that can serve as business records. All user interactions are handled through a simple, menu-driven interface, making it accessible even to those with minimal technical skills. The program employs functions, file handling, dictionaries, and input validation to provide a reliable and user-friendly solution for everyday inventory operations.
